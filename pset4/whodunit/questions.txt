1.  What is stdint.h?
stdint.h is a header file making it easier to use integers

2.  What's the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
These are fixed-width integers that allow code to be more portable between systems.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
BYTE - 1 byte; DWORD - 4 bytes; LONG - 4 bytes; WORD - 2 bytes.

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers".
BM

5.  What's the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the size of the whole BMP in bytes, biSize is the size of the INFOHEADER in bytes.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
This means the bitmap is top-down, as opposed to bottom-up.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
If there is no room to store the file in memory.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because there is always one element.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
1

11. What does fseek do?
Sets the file position of the stream to the given offset.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
The position in the file that is currently being accessed.
